# Bolygone

> A "bolygone" is a mathematical equivalent of a game for kids consisting
in creating nice figures with a piece of string around  nails on a
wooden board. Let be a circle with a radius=1, centered at point 0,0.
Let us consider an angle at centre i varying from  0 to 360 degrees
with a given step p. The bolygone of order n is the envelope of all the
cords joining each angle i to the angle n.i, where n is an integer > 1.
